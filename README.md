[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/du2x/pystro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/du2x/pystro) 

pystro is a **simple** and easy to use and to extend api for restaurant managements apps.

![use case diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.github.com/du2x/pystro/master/docs/basic_uc.uml)

pystro is written in Flask, tries to follow principles SOLID, KISS and DRY and Flask specific best practices, taking, for example, [miguelgrinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg) as one of the main references. We also follow pep8 style guide.

pystro uses SQLAlchemy as ORM framework. The models of pystro are those on the following class diagram:

pystro also uses Flask-Restful extension for better api design and creates a Flask Blueprint for each restaurant unit added on database, and registers the proper resources for them.

    `create user pystro@localhost;`

    `grant all privileges on pystro.* to pystro@localhost identified by 'devpassword';`

2. Create and activate the python virtualenv.

    `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
